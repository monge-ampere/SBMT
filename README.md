# Structured Bitmap-to-Mesh Triangulation (SBMT)

This repository contains a prototype implementation of **Structured Bitmap-to-Mesh Triangulation (SBMT)**, a rule-driven triangulation framework designed for raster domains. SBMT deterministically embeds polygonal boundaries into a regular triangular grid using a finite set of lookup templates.

---

## üîß Status

This is a **single-threaded prototype** implementation focused on algorithmic correctness. Current limitations include:

- No half-edge structure (triangles are stored and traversed via double loops)
- Brute-force handling of `$b$`-type retriangulation logic (sub-optimal and slow)
- No parallelism or GPU acceleration
- No support for adaptive refinement

Performance and data structure optimizations are planned for future versions.
