# Structured Bitmap-to-Mesh Triangulation (SBMT)

This repository contains a prototype implementation of **Structured Bitmap-to-Mesh Triangulation (SBMT)**, a rule-driven triangulation framework designed for **raster domains**.  
SBMT deterministically embeds polygonal boundaries into a regular triangular grid using a finite set of **lookup-table-based retriangulation templates**, supporting structure-aware numerical analysis on bitmap data.

---

## Status

This is a **single-threaded prototype** focused on demonstrating the core algorithmic principles. Current limitations include:

- No half-edge data structure: triangles are stored via flat arrays and accessed through double loops.
- Brute-force handling of `$b$`-type retriangulation logic: currently implemented in a slow, non-optimized manner.
- No parallel execution: neither multithreading nor GPU acceleration is currently supported.
- No adaptive refinement or local resolution control.
- **Platform limitation:** This version is tested and built exclusively with **Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 (Windows)**.  
  It currently **does not support cross-platform compilation** on Linux or macOS.

Performance optimization, algorithm modularization, and platform portability are planned for future versions.

## Platform Compatibility

- ✔️ Tested with: **Windows 10+ / Visual Studio 2015**
- ❌ Not tested on: Linux / macOS / gcc / clang
- No makefile or CMake script provided yet.
- Some C++11 features may require adjustment for compatibility with modern compilers.

Future versions will aim to provide:
- A modular build system (e.g., CMake)
- POSIX compatibility for Linux/macOS
